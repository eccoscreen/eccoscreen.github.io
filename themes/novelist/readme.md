## [Peter Y. Chuang - Novelist, Short Story Writer](https://novelist.xyz).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peterychuang/peterychuang.github.io.svg?branch=source)](https://travis-ci.org/peterychuang/peterychuang.github.io) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/peterychuang/peterychuang.github.io/tree/source.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/peterychuang/peterychuang.github.io/tree/source)

This is the Hugo source code for [Peter Y. Chuang - Novelist](https://novelist.xyz) website. The source code for the Jekyll version of the website can be found [here](https://github.com/peterychuang/peterychuang.github.io/tree/source-jekyll).

Originally, this was a fork of [{ Personal } Jekyll Theme by PanosSakkos](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme), which was a fork of [Timeline](https://github.com/kirbyt/timeline-jekyll-theme), and I borrowed some elements from [Grayscale](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/grayscale-theme) and [Feeling Responsive](https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive).

Over time, however, I've made numerous changes to the site, and a hard-disk failure made part of the source unrecoverable. As a result, a large part of the site, mainly the CSS, has been rebuilt from ground up using [Bootstrap Framework](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), the original framework that powered whichever site that the site I forked was based on, and it's probably not possible to see the trace of the original themes I forked to create this website.
