A science fiction masterpiece, *The Three-Body Problem* is an imaginative story dealing with human's communication with and the potential destruction by a hypothetical alien race from our nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, which is a three-star system (hence the name of the book).

With a scope even greater than *Star Wars*, *The Three-Body Problem* is a spectacle in itself, but it is also a setup for the next book in the series, *[The Dark Forest](/bookshelf/the-dark-forest-cixin-liu/)*, which takes the scope of the narrative to the next level and asks some serious questions for readers to ponder.
