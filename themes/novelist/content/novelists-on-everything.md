title: What great novelists say about everything
url: /novelists-on-everything/
---

This is a collection what great novelists have said about everything except writing (I have a separate page on writing coming up soon). As the page is pretty new, and as I am still experimenting the functionalities of [Hugo](/tech/hugo-vs-jekyll-static-site-generator/), this page is currently under testing and may be full of bugs and typos.

I will add more content and improve functionalities when I have time.
