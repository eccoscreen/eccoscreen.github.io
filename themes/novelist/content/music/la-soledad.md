> You came to me as poetry comes in song
> and you showed me a new world of passion.
> You loved me without conditions or reason
> while I ignorant of the meaning of love protected my heart.
>
> The sun has gone and now I sing of you
> this solitude consumes me.
> Forgive me if I was stolen away by fear.
> You came to me I did not know how to love
> all that is left is this song.

*A song originally by Pink Martini, with an odd presence of Chopin's Andate spianato and Grand Polonaise op. 22 in the middle of it*
