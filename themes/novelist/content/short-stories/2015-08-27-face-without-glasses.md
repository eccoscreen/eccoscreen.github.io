I have been wearing glasses since I was a kid, so I have always remembered myself having a pair of glasses on my face: my only memory of my face. The only times I can see myself not wearing glasses are those occasions when I look into the mirror while washing my face or something. But since my short-sightedness is serious, I can only see the image in the mirror clearly when I get very close to the mirror, which means I can only see a very small portion of my face in the mirror when I am not wearing my glasses. Without my glasses, I see my nose without seeing my lips, my eyes without my nose, and my lips without my eyes. I can never see the whole of my face without my pair of glasses.

Even though glasses have been a part of my body for so long, whenever I took photographs for passports and similar purposes, I have always been instructed by various photographers to take my glasses off, as if they were just as disposable as a scarf, a glove, or a pair shoes, something I can just take off and put something else on without turning myself into somebody else. This has always annoyed me, for I become practically blind in the process of the photo-shoot, which always makes me worried that I am going to do something wrong while the pictures are being taken. The resulting photographs of me without glasses have always been something that made me feel strange. Sometimes I blamed the photographers for blinding me, so that I did not know where to look, and the annoyance of being momentarily blind rendered me unable to smile, so that I looked wooden and miserable. But now that I think more carefully, I suppose I found them strange simply because I seldom see my whole face without glasses. When I look at those photographs now, my eyes seem too small, my nose too flat, and my eyebrows misplaced, as if I were not looking at the photographs of myself.

When I was small, I needed to go through this annual ritual of having those photographs taken. At my primary school, a school photographer would come to us, and all students would queue up at the door of the Music Room to get the pictures taken. Every time, the resulting photographs of me without spectacles looked so ugly that using those photographs on student handbook or any documents that required photographs always made me blush. As I grew up, those annual ritual faded out of fashion, and I have since believed that my appearance have changed dramatic since those days. With my glasses, my eyes now look the right size, my nose the right shape, and my eyebrows in their rightful place.

This belief, however, was proven completely wrong when I had a photo-shoot for my passport renewal. Since I have dual nationality, I have always had two passports, one of which I seldom used, thus it expired almost a decade ago. So when I renewed that long-expired passport, the original photograph in that old passport looks so ancient that I could not recognise myself — I was still a kid then. When I went to the photographer, he, to my annoyance, but not unexpectedly, instructed me to take off my glasses. The resulting photograph was of a stranger. I was quite furious with the result, but there was nothing I could do but to use that photograph for the passport, which did not look like a photograph of me. When I returned home and compared the new picture with that on my old passport, however, I realised that they were both of a same face. The eyes were too small, the nose too flat, and the eyebrows misplaced, but they were the same face. For so many years, I thought I have changed a lot since the annual photo-taking ritual ended. Perhaps I have not, after all. I have merely stopped looking at myself: a pair of fashionable glasses was much like heavy make-up that women put on their faces. Having got too used to seeing myself with it, I have troubled recognising myself without.

***

I remember that she wore glasses many years ago, and for years she wore contact lenses. Then before we got together after knowing each other for ten years or so, she went through the laser vision correction, and she no longer wore any glasses or lenses at all after that. My memory of her face has been fading since I last saw her years ago, but that memory most definitely does not consist of a pair of glasses, and when I try to think back to those years that she was still wearing glasses, I find nothing, as if I had never known her with glasses.

Though I remember very clearly that a friend of mine once said of the way she used her naturally curved fingers to push her glasses up. The finger nail of her forefinger would touch one of the hinges of the glasses, and the finger would move up lightly to push the glasses up. That friend of mine said that it was the most elegant way of adjusting the glasses. I have always remembered this description of her playing with her own glasses, even though glasses have long disappeared from my memory of her. All that remains is the idea of her adjusting an imaginary pair of glasses that she might not have worn at all.
