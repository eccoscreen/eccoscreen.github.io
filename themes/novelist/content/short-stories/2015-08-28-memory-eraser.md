It was the year twenty-two hundred.

You wished to forget everything that happened to you in the past five years, so you went to a hospital and demanded the mixture of drugs — advertised somewhere — that could erase your memory.

When you saw the doctor, he was reluctant to erase your memory straight away. He asked you tonnes of questions that annoyed you, and in the end, he said: “You will regret that, I know you will.”

“Why?” you asked.

“Most people do anyway once they find out what it means for them.”

But you were undeterred.

“Why did you advertise this service then if you are going to persuade me not to do this?”

The doctor said nothing. He looked at you with searching gaze as if he could see past your intention, which he could not. Whether he liked it or not, he had no alternative but to fulfil your wish: you asked for it, and you were going to pay for it. The doctor asked you to sign a contract and gave you a final warning.

“Remember, this is irreversible. But then, you won’t remember what I’ve just told you.”

You remained undeterred. Without reading a word of the contract, you sign the contract like you click the “agree” button on whatever application you run on your computer. After that, you pay the bill for that, and then some nurses led you to a bed and laid you down. They put some sensors on your skins and, after checking various readings from the machines, they put a oxygen mask onto your nose. You did not think too much about it, but you fell asleep.

***

The next day, you woke up from a blankness in the same bed. However, you had already forgotten how you got there. No one told you what had happened, not even the nurses, and when the doctor, whose face you had already forgotten, came to check if everything was fine, he said: “Very well then, it was successfully done.”

What? What does that even mean?

So you left the hospital without anyone telling you what happened. You thought that it was the year twenty-one ninety-five, for it was the date of your last memory. But everything — your watch, the calendar on your phone, the news — suggested that it was the year twenty-two hundred, and there was a war going on that you could not remember its having started. Startled, you tried to return home as soon as possible. And then you went the wrong way: the Tube Station was closed, the road leading to your home was blocked. And then, the door of your home was in a different colour.

Where were those five years? Were those five years missing? Did the calendar skip that five years? But why do I look thinner now than I last saw myself in the mirror?

You wanted to find out what happened in that five years.

Did I hurt my brain or something? I must find out why I lost the memory of the last five years.

After a few days of confusion, you finally met someone who claimed to know you. He was, at first, reluctant to talk to you when you were strolling alone at the seaside promenade, and you did not take notice of him until you discovered he could not take his eyes off you.

“Why are you looking at me like that?”

“I am Josh.”

“Who are you?” you asked. You could not remember his name, nor his face.

“I am sorry?” he said. “Can’t you remember me?”

“No.”

“I am sorry… please… forgive me…”

For what? you wondered. The expression of repentance on his face was absurd. Is he on drug?

***

At home, you found a photograph with you and Josh in it.

I knew him. Intimately.

Then you saw another photograph of him with someone else, taken by a private detective or something.

Did I hire a private detective to spy on him? I can’t remember any of it. Did he cheat on me? Who is he?

Who am I?

***

A letter came to your mailbox. It was a letter from the hospital.

> Congratulations on the success of your memory erasing treatment! You have now forgotten the last five years, as you requested. To help us improve our services, please kindly fill out the questionnaire enclosed in this letter and return it to us. We value our customers’ opinion.

I requested it? I paid for it? Really?

With your overwhelming urge to search for the past, you could not understand why you had, at some point, attempted to undergoing such a process of artificial amnesia, but at least, you thought, you now know what had happened to you. At the same time, you did not know what had happened to you. Looking at the photographs and trying to reconstruct the story, your so-called “past” seemed as distant as fairy tale. The memory of those five years had gone: it did not return no matter how hard you tried. You were only learning it like learning history.

You were not the you as you knew it any more.

The last question of the questionnaire read:

> Do you regret your decision?

Your answer:

Yes.
