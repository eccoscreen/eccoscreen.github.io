Sometime in 2011 or 2012, I began to [use Linux exclusively as my primary operating system](/linux/my-linux-journey/), and I've never returned to the Windows-land.

### My Linux Machine

<img src="/assets/img/linux-header.jpg" style="width:100%">

I use Dell XPS 13 (9350) mainly to write and develop this website, among many other things. For more demanding tasks such as photo-editing, I use a desktop machine with a quad-core processor and hyperthreading.

##### Specification (XPS 13)

* Intel Core i5-6200
* Full-HD Screen
* 8GB RAM
* 128 GB SSD

### Linux Distro of Choice

I use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) on all my Linux machines.

I first experimented with Arch Linux on my current XPS 13 because its newest hardware did not go very well with my previous Linux distro of choice, Linux Mint, which was, at that time, based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I got used to Arch Linux quite quickly (it's Linux, after all), and the access to the latest software packages from Arch repository and [AUR](//aur.archlinux.org) was a huge plus. After my success venture into Arch Linux, I moved all my remaining machines to Arch Linux.

Since the default install of Arch Linux only gets you a base system with almost nothing, here's [my recommendations for what to do after installing Arch Linux](/tech/things-to-do-after-installing-arch-linux/).

### Kernel

I use [Linux kernel with patches by Con Kolivas](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/linux-ck) on my desktop.

On my XPS 13, I switch between mainline and stock kernels.

~~On my XPS 13, I compiled my own kernel in the traditional way (i.e. downloading the source code from [kernel.org](//kernel.org) and patching it with additional fixes). At present, I am on 4.6.0-rc4 kernel with [patches provided by Frank Shin](//github.com/frank604/Dell-XPS-13-9350/tree/master/linux-dell) (thanks [Frank](//frankshin.com/)).~~

~~I use the pre-compiled kernel provided by Arch repository on all my machines except XPS 13.~~

### Theme

I use GNOME Desktop with [Flat-Plat-Blue theme](/linux/flat-plat-blue-gnome-gtk-theme-release), which I forked from Flat-Plat. The source code for the theme is available on my [Github Repository](//github.com/peterychuang/Flat-Plat-Blue).


### Applications I use to write

Mostly Libreoffice Writer, and increasingly Atom Editor when I write in Markdown.

### This website

This website is now generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go, and is hosted on a VPS instance which runs Ubuntu 16.04. I use [Caddy Webserver](https://caddyserver.com/), a new webserver written in Go; among its notable feature is automatic (and FREE!) SSL certificate issued by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
