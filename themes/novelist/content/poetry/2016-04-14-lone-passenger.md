Alone on a quiet, frozen train, I rode
With no one but the sound of speeding wheels.
Approaching the next station, the train slowed.
There, she announced her entrance with her heels.

I turned towards the new presence, who sat
With her face towards me. She was alone.
She smiled at me. My heart shuddered at that,
For she was both a known and an unknown —

She had to be a twin sister of yours
Whom you had never known. Her mere shadow
Had me shaken, as it opened the doors
For outburst of hot tears and great sorrow.

She left the train without any farewell;
Remembering you, I returned to hell.
