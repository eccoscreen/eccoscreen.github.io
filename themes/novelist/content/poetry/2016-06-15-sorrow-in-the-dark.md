The night is always when the sorrow grows:
The world is silent, everyone's asleep.
I sit alone and let my sadness flows,
My eyes run dry despite my urge to weep.

Your kindness gives me courage to survive,
Your caring touches me and warms my heart.
But all your words and words cannot revive
The sense of life that has been ripped apart.

The lights of city mask the twinkling stars,
But what would I feel if the stars were seen?
Would they have dug in more wounds and old scars?
Or long for you more than I've ever been?

I wait and wait and wait and wait and wait
For love to grow in you to change my fate.
