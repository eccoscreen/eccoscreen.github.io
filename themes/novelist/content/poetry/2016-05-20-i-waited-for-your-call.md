I watched my phone and waited for your call
But never heard from you nor seen your trace.
The endless waiting made my anguish tall,
My heart was pumping fast like running race.

The wine had not my poor nerve calmed the least,
The music roused my soul with bitter rage.
I closed my eyes and wished my pain decreased,
The storm in me was trapped within a cage.

My tears were falling through the stale sad air,
Your face appeared inside my drunken mind:
A face which meant beyond just sweet and fair,
But a heart more than just gentle and kind.

I love your face your heart your mind your soul,
A love unceased until the earth grows old.
